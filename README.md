## Introdution  
This is an exercise in developing a chatbot to work with Open AI.  
The functionality is quite simple; the user types a question into the input field, hits enter or clicks on the arrow head to the right and a response is received from Open AI.  
In the large window above, the back-and-forth conversation between user and Open AI is displayed and can be scrolled. There is also a copy-to-clipboard feature to the side of each of the messages.
